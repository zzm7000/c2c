The Country to Country CTF (C2C CTF) Cybersecurity Challenge is a five year series of international CTF competitions organized by INCS-CoE with leading international universities.

The inaugural competition hosted by Royal Holloway University in 2020 boasted 150 students from across Australia, Israel, Japan, UK and US. The students represented different universities, genders, skill levels, and background. To foster networking, students are organized into collaborative teams with a diverse makeup of students from different backgrounds and different countries.

In 2021, the interest from students grew and 378 students registered for the competition. The finals hosted by Technion Hiroshi Fujiwara Cyber Security Research Center consisted of 30 teams of five students each. Monetary prizes were awarded to the top three teams and honorary prizes were awarded to five additional teams all solving 29 of 30 challenges as well as the top three individual performers in the qualifying round.
