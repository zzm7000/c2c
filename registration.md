### Ethics

You participate in this competition as an ethical hacker and, although you might use some of the same tools used by the bad guys, there are some activities that you should not engage with. In particular, the following activities are prohibited:

Any activities or actions that would interfere, obstruct, or disturb other teams, participants, and event organizers
Spying on other teams, participants, and event organizers
Providing hints, clues, or answers to participants other than your own team members
Seeking or receiving hints, clues, or answers from participants other than your own team members – a hint or a clue provided by event organizers to all participants would be acceptable

### Tiebreakers

In the event of a tie, the following tiebraker criteria will be applied to determine the winner:

The total time between a team's first challenge opened and the last successful flag submission.
The smallest number of total challenges solved between equal points teams (hardest challenges solved).
If the event organizers find any prohibited activities, they have the right to deduct points or disqualify a team. Same penalties would be applied even if event organizers find any prohibited activities before and after the competition (e.g., Dry Run, Award Ceremony). In all these cases, the organizers reserve the right to contact the University of the applicant to notify them about this behavior.
